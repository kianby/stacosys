## Stacosys

Stacosys (aka STAtic blog COmment SYStem) is a fork of [Pecosys](http://github.com/kianby/pecosys) trying to fix Pecosys design drawbacks and to provide a basic alternative to comment hosting services like Disqus. Stacosys works with any static blog or even a simple HTML page. 

###  Features overview

Stacosys main feature is comment management.

Here is the workflow:

-    Readers submit comments via a comment form embedded in blog pages
-    Blog administrator receives an e-mail notification from Stacosys when a
     comment is submitted
-    Blog administrator can approve or drop the comment through a simple web admin interface
-    Stacosys stores approved comment in its database.

Privacy concerns: only surname, gravatar id and comment itself are stored in DB. E-mail is optionally requested in submission form to resolve gravatar id but never sent to Stacosys.

Stacosys is more or less localized (english and french).

### Technically speaking, how does it work?

Stacosys offers a REST API to retrieve and post comments. Static blog is HTML-based and a piece of JavaScript code interacts with Stacosys using HTTP requests. Each page has a unique id and a request allows retrieving comments for a given page. Similarly, a form request allows to post a comment which is relayed to the administrator by e-mail. For this purpose an SMTP configuration is needed.

### Little FAQ

*How do you block spammers?*

- Current comment form is basic: no captcha support but protected by a honeypot. 

*Which database is used?*

- SQLite.

*Which technologies are used?*

-    [Python](https://www.python.org)
-    [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
-    [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)

### Installation

Build and Dependency management relies on [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) but you can also use [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kianby/stacosys).

Build executable with pyinstaller 

    make build

Update dependencies and sync virtual env

    rye lock --update-all
    rye sync

### Improvements

Stacosys fits my needs, and it manages comments on [my blog](https://blogduyax.madyanne.fr) for a while. I don't have any plan to make big changes, it's more a python playground for me. So I strongly encourage you to fork and enhance the project if you need additional features.
